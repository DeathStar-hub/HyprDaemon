## Session: ses_3b87 (2026-02-22 - from Feb 10)

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Groups:** computer, development

### Summary
Fixed Walker menu CSS import path (relative to absolute). Discussed multi-computer sync issues with Syncthing causing lost work. Explored GitHub as solution for version control and branch tracking across computers.

### Key Points
- Fixed Walker menu CSS: changed relative import to absolute path
- Theme colors: Base `#0e091d`, Text `#11AEB3`, Border `#a60234`, Selected `#c8e967`
- Syncing between computers via Syncthing caused accidental overwrites
- Need better version control solution for multi-computer workflow

### Decisions Made
- Explored GitHub for branch/version tracking
- Would allow tracking changes per computer before merging

### Topics
Walker, CSS, theme, multi-computer sync, GitHub, version control, Syncthing

### End Context
Q: ok working update progress on that and then have a look through AI see what were missing , i just synced the AI folder with a refresh of work i was doing on another comp , you may be missing some new functions , but have a look for any changes that take away anything we might have made on this comp and didn't get synced so lost as a side branch on the project , also give me options for simple solutions like github to control itterations or branches of the project something the ai could easily keep track of so if one comp branches off its easier to track and manages changes to the project over multiple comps sometimes synced through syncthing not in any regular or orginised pattern other than trying to not overwright projects acedently
A: Found walker menu CSS fix, discussed GitHub options for multi-computer version control
