### Summary
Fixed jl command not working due to PATH issue. Zoxide was installed but not accessible because /usr/bin wasn't in PATH. Created symlink to fix.

### Key Points
- zoxide installed at /usr/bin/zoxide but not in PATH
- Created symlink ~/.local/bin/zoxide → /usr/bin/zoxide
- Changed jl from `ls -Alh` to `ls`

### Files Modified
- ~/.config/fish/functions/jl.fish
- ~/.local/bin/zoxide (symlink)

### Topics
fish shell, zoxide, symlink, PATH

### Packages
