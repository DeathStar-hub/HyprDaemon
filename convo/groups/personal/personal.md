**Topic:** Alberta truck driver tax deductions - comprehensive guide

### Key Points
- **Single employer filing:** Easy to file solo using CRA Auto-fill or free software (UFile, TurboTax)

  - Simplified method: $69.30/day when away 12+ hours and sleeping away
  - Detailed method: 50% of actual meal costs with receipts
- **Vehicle/truck deductions:** Daily commute (home to shop) is NOT deductible
  - Exception possible if no fixed workplace AND transport heavy tools
  - Gray area - consult CPA
- **Cell phone/computer:** Can claim business-use portion (need to track %)
- **Other deductions:** Union dues, professional licenses, safety equipment, training courses

### Decisions Made
- User understood commuting is not deductible
- Will track mileage for potential future claims

Q: do i get a tax deduction for my truck since i have to drive a km to work and back every day
A: No - commuting is not deductible, but user may have case since they have no fixed workplace and haul heavy equipment (gray area - recommend CPA)
