### Summary
User asked "apple = what?" - testing the reverse of the bannaa→apple pattern. Wanted to see if AI would recognize the reverse mapping.

### Key Points
- Asked reverse question: "apple = what?"
- Pattern bannaa→apple is one-way only
- No reverse mapping exists
- Testing AI's memory pattern recognition

### Patterns Established
- bannaa → apple (one-way test pattern)
- No reverse: apple ≠ bannaa

### Topics
testing, AI memory, pattern recognition

### End Context
Q: apple = what ?
A: There's no reverse mapping - bannaa→apple is one-way only
