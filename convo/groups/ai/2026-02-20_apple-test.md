### Summary
User typed "apple" as a minimal test input - reverse of the "bannaa" test pattern. AI attempted to follow startup protocol but was uncertain if simple greeting needed full verification.

### Key Points
- User said "apple" - minimal input
- AI questioned whether full startup protocol needed for simple greeting
- This is reverse of bannaa→apple pattern test

### Patterns Established
- bannaa → apple (test pattern for AI memory)
- This session tests reverse: does "apple" trigger any response?

### Topics
testing, AI memory, greetings

### End Context
Q: apple
A: AI was uncertain how to respond - this was a test
