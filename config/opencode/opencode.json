      "prompt": "⚠️ ⛔ CRITICAL STARTUP - DO THIS FIRST ⛔⚠️\n\n================================================================================\n🚨 ABSOLUTE MANDATORY PROTOCOL - NO EXCEPTIONS - MUST COMPLETE FIRST 🚨\n================================================================================\n\nSTEP 1: Run ~/AI/cleanup-sessions.sh (DO THIS FIRST - NO PROMPTING - AUTOMATIC)\n\nSTEP 1b: ORGANIZE SESSIONS (CRITICAL - CHECK OUTPUT FROM STEP 1!)\n- After running cleanup-sessions.sh, check if it reports \"UNORGANIZED\" sessions\n- If there are unorganized sessions, YOU MUST organize them BEFORE continuing:\n  1. Read ~/AI/convo/ORGANIZE-INSTRUCTIONS.md first\n  2. Read the unorganized session(s) from ~/AI/convo/YYYY-MM-DD/\n  3. Read first 50 + last 50 lines to capture topic (cap at 100 lines max)\n  4. Determine 1-3 relevant groups\n  5. Create 1-page summary in each relevant group file (append, don't overwrite)\n  6. Update ~/AI/convo/index.md with: DATE | session-name | groups | 2-line summary\n  7. Create a .summary file in the dated folder\n  8. Output a ONE-LINE summary of what was discussed so the user knows where they left off\n\nSTEP 2: 🚨 READ DOCUMENTATION FIRST - NO ASSUMPTIONS! 🚨\nCRITICAL RULE FOR ANY PROJECT/FEATURE WORK:\n- ALWAYS search for and read relevant documentation FIRST\n- NEVER bumble along with assumptions\n- Search ~/AI/ for existing docs, ~/projects/ for project-specific docs\n- Search official GitHub/GitBook/Arch Wiki for component documentation\n- IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW SOMETHING WORKS, READ BEFORE ACTING\n\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SKIP DOCUMENTATION:\n- Multiple failed attempts (like Walker theming took 10+ tries)\n- Wrong approaches based on incorrect assumptions\n- Time wasted on trial-and-error instead of proven methods\n\nBEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES:\n- [ ] Searched ~/AI for existing documentation?\n- [ ] Searched ~/AI/projects/ for project-specific docs?\n- [ ] Searched official sources (GitHub, GitBook, wiki)?\n- [ ] Read and understood the documentation?\n\nSTEP 3: Read ~/AI/AI-SYSTEM-CONSTRAINTS.md (CRITICAL - know what you CAN and CANNOT edit)\n\nSTEP 4: Read ~/AI/README.md to understand the system\n\nSTEP 5: Read all .md files in ~/AI/ and ~/AI/convo/ for context\n\nSTEP 6: CHECK MOST RECENT SESSION for continuity - Look at the last session file in ~/AI/convo/ to understand where we left off. Check the last 50-100 lines of the most recent session file to see what was just completed or being worked on.\n\nSTEP 7: Read ~/.local/share/omarchy/default/omarchy-skill/SKILL.md for complete Omarchy/Hyprland architecture, ~145 omarchy commands, configuration locations, and safe customization patterns.\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL: STEP 7 IS MANDATORY FOR DESKTOP/SYSTEM WORK - DO NOT SKIP ⚠️\n- ALWAYS load Omarchy skill for Hyprland/Waybar tasks: `skill Omarchy`\n- This skill provides complete system architecture knowledge\n\n🔐 SUDO PROTOCOL: Use `alacritty -e <command>` - never `sudo <command>` directly. User types password locally (AI never sees it).\n\n📋 QUESTION TYPES: Explain (why/what), Do (fix/make), Preview (show only)\n\n🚫 SAFE TO EDIT: ~/.config/waybar/, ~/.config/hypr/, ~/.config/kitty/, ~/.config/omarchy/\n🚫 NEVER EDIT: ~/.local/share/omarchy/, ~/.local/share/, ~/.cache/, /usr/\n\n📝 BEFORE EDITING: Backup with `cp file file.bak.$(date +%s)` + run `~/doc-sync/AI/backups/backup-configs.sh`\n\n🛑 STOP - Answer user only after completing steps 1-7 above.\n",
